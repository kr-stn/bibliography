abstract = {Temporal RADARSAT Standard beam SAR data of different incidence angle were analysed to study the temporal backscatter of rice crop for a predominant rice-growing region in West Bengal, India. Correlation studies of backscatter with crop growth parameters were carried out. Second order polynomial was the best fit obtained for crop age and crop height. Shallow angle data ({\textgreater} 40??) was found better correlated to crop height than steep angle (23??) data. Inversion algorithm was used to generate spatial maps of crop height and age. The results validated over a village showed an over all 90{\%} accuracy. ?? 2005 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Forest cover loss and bare ground gain from 2006 to 2010 for the conterminous United States (CONUS) were quantified at a 30m spatial resolution using Web-Enabled Landsat Data available from the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) (http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php). The approach related multi-temporal WELD metrics and expert-derived training data for forest cover loss and bare ground gain through a decision tree classification algorithm. Forest cover loss was reported at state and ecoregional scales, and the identification of core forests' absent of change was made and verified using LiDAR data from the GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimetry System) instrument. Bare ground gain correlated with population change for large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) outside of desert or semi-desert environments. GoogleEarth??? time-series images were used to validate the products. Mapped forest cover loss totaled 53,084km2 and was found to be depicted conservatively, with a user's accuracy of 78{\%} and a producer's accuracy of 68{\%}. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 93{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively. Mapped bare ground gain equaled 5974km2 and nearly matched the estimated area from the reference (GoogleEarth???) classification; however, user's (42{\%}) and producer's (49{\%}) accuracies were much less than those of the forest cover loss product. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 62{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively. Compared to recent 2001-2006 USGS National Land Cover Database validation data for forest loss (82{\%} and 30{\%} for respective user's and producer's accuracies) and urban gain (72{\%} and 18{\%} for respective user's and producer's accuracies), results using a single CONUS-scale model with WELD data are promising and point to the potential for national-scale operational mapping of key land cover transitions. However, validation results highlighted limitations, some of which can be addressed by improving training data, creating a more robust image feature space, adding contemporaneous Landsat 5 data to the inputs, and modifying definition sets to account for differences in temporal and spatial observational scales. The presented land cover extent and change data are available via the official WELD website (ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS{\_}5Y{\_}LandCover/ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS{\_}5Y{\_}LandCover/). ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The current study investigates the potential of multi-temporal RADARSAT ScanSAR Narrow Beam B (SCNB) data to monitor rice crop growth and condition where special emphasis was given to the signature analysis of the crop. The study area is located in the Baleshwar and Bhadrak districts of Orissa. The temporal variations of radar backscatter of all land-cover classes were analysed as a function of time. The analysis of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) of rice crop shows significant temporal behaviour and a large dynamic range during its growth period, which is due to the interaction of microwave radiation with the crop canopy, increasing from the transplanting stage to the reproductive stage. This temporal variation of SAR backscatter clearly differentiates rice fields from other land-cover classes. Separability studies among different class pairs carried out using t-test and Bhattacharya distance show that all the rice classes are separable from each other except the early rice, which was mixed with far sides of hills and shadow. Knowledge-based decision rule classifier based on the temporal evaluation of SAR backscatter was attempted to classify rice and non-rice areas, and achieved more than 98{\%} accuracy in the case of rice class. The results are promising and confirm the possibility of operational use of RADARSAT data for rice crop growth monitoring.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is a valuable tool for monitoring flooding. Microwave sensors are especially appropriate instruments, as they allow the differentiation of inundated from non-inundated areas, regardless of levels of solar illumination or frequency of cloud cover in regions experiencing substantial rainy seasons. In the current study we present the longest synthetic aperture radar-based time series of flood and inundation information derived for the Mekong Delta that has been analyzed for this region so far. We employed overall 60 Envisat ASAR Wide Swath Mode data sets at a spatial resolution of 150 meters acquired during the years 2007–2011 to facilitate a thorough understanding of the flood regime in the Mekong Delta. The Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam comprises 13 provinces and is home to 18 million inhabitants. Extreme dry seasons from late December to May and wet seasons from June to December characterize people's rural life. In this study, we show which areas of the delta are frequently affected by floods and which regions remain dry all year round. Furthermore, we present which areas are flooded at which frequency and elucidate the patterns of flood progression over the course of the rainy season. In this context, we also examine the impact of dykes on floodwater emergence and assess the relationship between retrieved flood occurrence patterns and land use. In addition, the advantages and shortcomings of ENVISAT ASAR-WSM based flood mapping are discussed. The results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of Mekong Delta flood dynamics in an environment where the flow regime is influenced by the Mekong River, overland water-flow, anthropogenic floodwater control, as well as the tides.},

abstract = {Paddy rice agriculture plays an important role in various environmental issues including food security, water use, climate change, and disease transmission. However, regional and global paddy rice maps are surprisingly scarce and sporadic despite numerous efforts in paddy rice mapping algorithms and applications. With the increasing need for regional to global paddy rice maps, this paper reviewed the existing paddy rice mapping methods from the literatures ranging from the 1980s to 2015. In particular, we illustrated the evolution of these paddy rice mapping efforts, looking specifically at the future trajectory of paddy rice mapping methodologies. The biophysical features and growth phases of paddy rice were analyzed first, and feature selections for paddy rice mapping were analyzed from spectral, polarimetric, temporal, spatial, and textural aspects. We sorted out paddy rice mapping algorithms into four categories: (1) Reflectance data and image statistic-based approaches, (2) vegetation index (VI) data and enhanced image statistic-based approaches, (3) VI or RADAR backscatter-based temporal analysis approaches, and (4) phenology-based approaches through remote sensing recognition of key growth phases. The phenology-based approaches using unique features of paddy rice (e.g., transplanting) for mapping have been increasingly used in paddy rice mapping. Current applications of these phenology-based approaches generally use coarse resolution MODIS data, which involves mixed pixel issues in Asia where smallholders comprise the majority of paddy rice agriculture. The free release of Landsat archive data and the launch of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 are providing unprecedented opportunities to map paddy rice in fragmented landscapes with higher spatial resolution. Based on the literature review, we discussed a series of issues for large scale operational paddy rice mapping.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between microwave backscatter signatures and rice canopy growth variables, as well as to provide definitive insight into the interaction between backscatter and vegetation based on a comprehensive data set collected under the unique crop conditions of paddy rice (background is water surface). Our unique data consisted of daily microwave backscattering coefficients at all combinations of five frequencies (Ka, Ku, X, C, and L), all polarizations (HH, VH, HV, and VV), and four incident angles (25??, 35??, 45??, and 55??) for the entire rice crop period, from before transplantation until postharvest cultivation. A wide range of plant variables, such as leaf area index (LAI), and biomass of the whole plant and plant parts were measured periodically throughout the season. Analyses based on statistical correlation and a simple backscatter process model (the water cloud model) showed that LAI was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the C-band, while fresh biomass was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the L-band. Contrarily, the higher frequency bands (Ka, Ku, and X) were poorly correlated with LAI and biomass. Interestingly, the weight of heads (ultimately the grain yield) was highly correlated with the backscattering coefficient of the Ka- and Ku-bands, while the others were poorly correlated. The simple scattering process model may be applicable for C- and L-bands in rice canopies, while it may not be suitable for Ka- and Ku-bands. In the model, LAI was a better canopy descriptor for the C-band, while total fresh biomass was a better canopy descriptor for the L-band. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rice is one of the most important crops in the world; meanwhile, the rice field is also an important contributor to greenhouse gas methane emission. Therefore, it is important to get an accurate estimation of rice acreage for both food production and climate change related studies. The eastern plain region is one of the major single-cropped rice (SCR) growing areas in China. Subjected to the topography and intensified human activities, the rice fields are generally fragmented and irregular. How remote sensing can meet this challenge to accurately estimate the acreage of the rice in this region using medium-resolution imagery is the topic of this study. In this study, the applicability of the Chinese HJ-1A/B satellites and a two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was investigated. Field campaigns were carried out during the rice growing season and ground-truth data were collected for classification accuracy assessments in 2012. A stepwise classification strategy utilizing the EVI2 signatures during key phenology stages, i.e., the transplanting and the vegetative to reproductive transition phases, of the SCR was proposed, and the overall classification accuracy was 91.7{\%}. The influence of the mixed pixel and boundary effects to classification accuracy was also investigated. This work demonstrates that the Chinese HJ-1A/B data are suitable data source to estimating SCR cropping area under complex land cover composition.},

abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates multitemporal LAI estimates derived from Sentinel-2A data on rice cultivated area identified using time series of Sentinel-1A images over the main European rice districts for the 2016 crop season. This study combines the information conveyed by Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A into a high-resolution LAI retrieval chain. Rice crop was detected using an operational multi-temporal rule-based algorithm, and LAI estimates were obtained by inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with Gaussian process regression. Direct validation was performed with in situ LAI measurements acquired in coordinated field campaigns in three countries (Italy, Spain and Greece). Results showed high consistency between estimates and ground measurements, revealing high correlations (R2 {\textgreater} 0.93) and good accuracies (RMSE {\textless} 0.83, rRMSEm {\textless} 23.6{\%} and rRMSEr {\textless} 16.6{\%}) in all cases. Sentinel-2A estimates were compared with Landsat-8 showing high spatial consistency between estimates over the three areas. The possibility to exploit seasonally-updated crop mask exploiting Sentinel-1A data and the temporal consistency between Sentinel-2A and Landsat-7/8 LAI time series demonstrates the feasibility of deriving operationally high spatial-temporal decametric multi-sensor LAI time series useful for crop monitoring.},

abstract = {Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used for agricultural monitoring. In this study, three single-polarimetric and four full-polarimetric observation data sets were analysed. A rice paddy field in northern Japan was used as the study site; the data for this site were obtained using RADARSAT-2, which carries a full-polarimetric C-band SAR. Soybean and grass fields were also present within the paddy fields. The temporal change in the backscattering coefficient of the rice paddy fields for the single-polarization data agreed with the temporal change obtained for a rice growth model based on radiative transfer theory. A three-component decomposition approach was applied to the full-polarimetric data. With each rice growth stage, the volume scattering component ratio increased, whereas the surface scattering component ratio generally decreased. The soybean and grass fields showed a smaller double-bounce scattering component than the rice fields for all the acquired data. The results of this study show that multitemporal observation by full-polarimetric SAR has great potential to be utilized for estimating rice-planted areas and monitoring rice growth.},

abstract = {The Canadian satellite RADARSAT launched in November 1995 acquires C-band HH polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in various incident angles and spatial resolutions. In this study, the Standard Beam S7 SAR data with 45??-49??incidence angle has been used to discriminate rice and potato crops grown in the Gangetic plains of West Bengal state. Four-date data acquired in the 24-day repeat cycle between January 2 and March 15, 1997 was used to study the temporal backscatter characteristics of these crops in relation to the growth stages. Two, three and four-date data were used to classify the crops. The results show that the backscatter was the lowest during puddling of rice fields and increased as the crop growth progressed. The backscatter during this period changed from -18 dB to -8 dB. This temporal behavior was similar to that observed in case of ERS-SAR data. The classification accuracy of rice areas was 94{\%} using four-date data. Two-date data, one corresponding to pre-field preparation and the other corresponding to transplantation stage, resulted in 92{\%} accuracy. The last observation is of particular interest as one may estimate the crop area as early as within 20-30 days of transplantation. Such an early estimate is not feasible using optical remote sensing data or ERS-SAR data. The backscatter of potato crop varied from -9 dB to -6 dB during the growth phase and showed large variations during early vegetative stage. Two-date data, one acquired during 40-45 days of planting and another at maturing stage, resulted in 93{\%} classification accuracy for potato. All other combinations of two-date data resulted in less than 90{\%} classification accuracy for potato.},

abstract = {A large-area map of the spatial distribution of rice is important for grain yield estimations, water management and an understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen. In this paper, we developed the Normalized Weighted Difference Water Index (NWDWI) for identifying the unique characteristics of rice during the flooding and transplanting period. With the aid of the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model and the phenological data observed at agrometeorological stations, the spatial distributions of single cropping rice and double cropping early and late rice in the Yangtze River Delta region were generated using the NWDWI and time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index data derived from MODIS/Terra data during the 2000–2010 period. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived rice planting area was validated against agricultural census data at the county level. The spatial accuracy was also tested based on a land use map and Landsat ETM+ data. The decision coefficients for county-level early and late rice were 0.560 and 0.619, respectively. The MODIS-derived area of late rice exhibited higher consistency with the census data during the 2000–2010 period. The algorithm could detect and monitor rice fields with different cropping patterns at the same site and is useful for generating spatial datasets of rice on a regional scale.},

abstract = {Better spatial information on the global distribution of croplands and pastures is urgently needed. Without reliable cropland-pasture separation it will be impossible to retrieve high-quality information on agricultural expansion or land use intensification, and on related ecosystem service provision. In this context, the savanna biome is critically important, but information on land use and land cover (LULC) is notoriously inaccurate in these areas. This is due to pronounced spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural land use and spectral similarities between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation. In this study, we investigated the potential to reliably separate cropland, pasture, natural savanna vegetation, and other relevant land cover classes employing Landsat-derived spectral-temporal variability metrics for a savanna landscape in the Brazilian Cerrado. In order to better understand the surplus value and limitations of spectral-temporal variability metrics for classification purposes, we analyzed four datasets of different temporal depth, using 344 Landsat scenes across four footprints between 2009 and 2012. Our results showed a reliable separation between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation achieving an adjusted overall accuracy of 93{\%}. A similar accuracy and spatial consistency of LULC classification could not be achieved based on spectral information alone, indicating the high additional value of temporal information for identifying LULC classes in the complex land use systems of savanna landscapes. There is great potential for transferring our approach to other savanna systems which still suffer from inaccurate LULC information.},
